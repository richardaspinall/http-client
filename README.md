## Description
A hands-on labs to show the power of creating a Native app across multiple platforms with Kotlin. 

## Results
I think there are some assumptions that you are coming from Java when doing these labs. It's mostly about configuring the build of the application 
but the instructions seem a bit outdated (the config files for Gradle that are created through IntelliJ end up being quite different).

I sent some feedback mentioning that the documentation might be outdated for newbs which will hopefully help stop someone from running into the same troubles I had: https://github.com/kotlin-hands-on/intro-kotlin-native/issues/2


### Skills
* Familarity with IntelliJ
* Familarity with Gradle

**Note** There wasn't any learning of Kotlin but I wasn't expecting that.
